ADDITIONAL LICENSING NOTES:

1. eBPF Programs (\*.bpf.c files):
   Individual eBPF kernel-space programs in this repository use GPL-2.0 license
   as required by the Linux kernel. These files are clearly marked with:

   // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-2.0

   This dual-licensing approach is standard in eBPF projects because:

   - eBPF programs that run in kernel space must be GPL-compatible
   - User-space loaders and tooling can use more permissive licenses

2. User-Space Code and Documentation:
   All user-space code (loaders, applications), documentation, and build
   systems remain under MIT license as specified above.

3. Third-Party Dependencies:
   This project uses various dependencies with their own licenses:

   - libbpf: LGPL-2.1 OR BSD-2-Clause
   - BCC: Apache-2.0
   - Cilium eBPF Go library: Apache-2.0
   - Linux kernel headers: GPL-2.0

   Please review their respective licenses when using or redistributing.
